# FitScribe React App

This repo conatins all the files for the client of my FitScribe site, built using React. The goal of this site is to create an easy-to-use platform for users to build and plan workout routines. 

Initial functionality will focus on allowing users to create and save workout routines to pull up and follow while they are at the gym. The primary focus at the outset will be on strength training but I plan to incorporate things like cardio, yoga, etc in the future. I'm also planning to add in some performance tracking functionality to allow users to monitor their progress.
